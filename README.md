Mario game

This is the initial version of the game I wrote which was also presented
at LOCUS. Unfortunately, I lost the complete game that was presented at LOCUS. 
I somehow found this glitchy(e.g. no nearest brick hit during a jump) version from my friend(it had menu, audio, ducks, 
mushrooms, level finish flag).
